<h1>The Best Movies According to Rowena</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Notorious</h3>
<p>A fantastic WW2 tale of love and intrigue, way ahead of it's time by Alfred Hitchcock. Starring Carey Grant, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Raines</p>
<h3>LA Confidential</h3>
<p>Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pierce and Kim Basinger and a host of stars are wonderfully cast in this drama of dark things which should be hush! Hush!</p>
<h3>The Waterboy</h3>
<p>An odd choice, I know, but this is the only movie that makes me do the guy thing of laughing at it like it's the first time I've seen it even though it's the 100th time!</p>
